If you have ever played Minecraft, you know the feeling of throwing an Ender Pearl. You toss a small, glowing green orb, watch it arc through the air, hear a shattering sound, and suddenly you are standing exactly where it landed. It is a simple, convenient way to cross ravines or escape danger.

It is one of those mechanics you accept immediately. It is just how the Minecraft world works. I used to treat it that way too. Then I made the mistake of looking at the numbers behind it.

### The Scale of the World

To understand the pearl, we first need to understand the size of the world. Minecraft operates on a very strict spatial grid where one standard block is exactly one cubic meter. Because the game's textures are drawn on a 16 by 16 pixel grid, we have a reliable, hard-coded measurement system: every pixel in the game represents exactly 6.25 centimeters.

When we hold an Ender Pearl in our inventory, the sprite is 13 pixels across. Applying our measurement rule, the Ender Pearl has a diameter of 81.25 centimeters, or a radius of 0.406 meters. This means its total volume, calculated using the standard formula for a sphere, is $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$, which comes out to roughly 0.281 cubic meters. You are not holding a golf ball; you are holding a solid, glass-like sphere that is larger than a beach ball.

This massive size actually makes perfect sense from a biological perspective. The original owners of these pearls are Endermen, towering creatures that stand exactly three meters tall with incredibly long, highly leveraged limbs. To an Enderman, an 81-centimeter sphere fits comfortably in the palm of their hand. When your human-sized character picks one up, you are essentially hijacking the biological hardware of an apex dimensional predator.

### The Weight of a Snowball

To figure out how heavy the Ender Pearl is, we have to look at how it flies. Game engines are incredibly consistent, and Minecraft treats the flight path of an Ender Pearl exactly the same as the flight path of a snowball. They leave your hand at the exact same speed of 1.5 blocks per tick, experience the exact same aerodynamic drag coefficient of 0.99, and fall to the ground with the exact same gravitational acceleration of 0.03 blocks per tick squared. Because you throw them with the exact same effort and they fly identically, they must have roughly the same mass.

We can calculate the mass of a snowball easily. The in-game snowball sprite is 12 pixels wide, giving it a diameter of 75 centimeters and a radius of 0.375 meters. Running this through our volume equation gives us 0.221 cubic meters of snow. Real-world packed snow has a density ranging from 370 to 560 kilograms per cubic meter. By multiplying our volume by these densities, we find that a Minecraft snowball weighs between 81.7 kilograms and 123.7 kilograms. Let us average that out to an even 100 kilograms.

Therefore, your Ender Pearl also weighs roughly 100 kilograms. However, since the pearl is slightly larger than the snowball but weighs the same, we know a bit about its internal structure. If we divide that 100-kilogram mass by the pearl's 0.281 cubic meter volume, we get a density between 290 and 440 kilograms per cubic meter. This is incredibly light - roughly the density of balsa wood, cork, or dried pumice. Because we also know it shatters instantly upon impact like glass, we can conclude the Ender Pearl is entirely hollow. It is a rigid, brittle shell housing a massive internal vacuum or an incredibly porous aerogel structure.

### The Mechanics of the Throw

Now we have to look at the throw itself. When you use the item, the game launches the pearl at a speed of 30 meters per second, which translates to 108 kilometers per hour.

You are taking a 100-kilogram, hollow glass orb and hurling it at highway speeds with a flick of your wrist. To find out exactly how much effort that takes, we use the standard kinetic energy formula:

$$E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

Plugging in our 100-kilogram mass and our velocity of 30 meters per second, we get:

$$E_k = \frac{1}{2}(100)(30)^2 = 45,000 \text{ Joules}$$

Your character must impart exactly 45,000 Joules of kinetic energy into the pearl in a fraction of a second. For context, a standard 9mm bullet carries about 500 Joules of energy. You are generating 90 times the kinetic energy of a firearm using nothing but your arm muscles. This is the kinetic equivalent of a small car crash.

### The Teleportation Event

(This is the "sci-fi" part. Treat them all as assumptions and guesses within the thought experiment.)

The most fascinating part of the Ender Pearl is what happens when it lands. In the game's code, every thrown pearl is assigned an "Owner" data tag, linking it permanently to the player who threw it. In real-world physics, we call this quantum entanglement.

The hollow vacuum inside the pearl's brittle shell contains a localized bundle of matter native to the End dimension. This matter is quantumly entangled with your exact biological signature. As the pearl flies through the air at 108 kilometers per hour, this delicate state remains perfectly suspended.

When the 100-kilogram pearl hits a solid surface at full speed, the brittle outer shell shatters completely. The internal vacuum is suddenly exposed to the standard Overworld atmosphere. This catastrophic structural failure triggers an instantaneous wave-function collapse, forcing the entangled matter to react and creating an instantaneous spatial fold - an Einstein-Rosen bridge, or wormhole. Because the entanglement is locked specifically to your physical mass, the coordinate translation exists purely within your inertial frame of reference. This is why if you throw a pearl while falling, you keep your falling momentum after teleporting; the spatial fold moves you, but it does not erase your kinetic energy.

### The Cost of Traveling

Every time you teleport with an Ender Pearl, your character takes two and a half hearts of damage. In the game, this translates to five points of health, or roughly one-quarter of your total life force. We can finally explain why this hurts so much using thermodynamics.

When the wormhole activates, you instantly vanish from your starting location. This leaves behind a perfect, human-sized vacuum. The surrounding atmosphere violently rushes in to fill the empty space, colliding with itself and creating a localized sonic boom.

Simultaneously, you instantly appear at your destination. A standard human body takes up about 80 liters, or 0.08 cubic meters, of space. You forcefully displace this exact volume of air in zero time. Because the air cannot flow out of your way smoothly, it hyper-compresses around your body, generating a massive adiabatic spike in heat and pressure. The 2.5 hearts of damage you take is not magical in nature. It is the severe thermodynamic trauma of surviving a massive pressure wave and macro-scale cavitation every single time you cross space.

The next time you are building a base or running from a skeleton, and you casually toss an Ender Pearl across a ravine, take a moment to appreciate the physics. You are wielding the hyper-dense, quantumly entangled biology of a dimensional predator and surviving a localized atmospheric shockwave, all before the sun goes down.

**A Quick Disclaimer:** Before the physics police arrive: yes, this is a thought experiment. To make the math work, a few standard physical modeling assumptions had to be made, namely equating aerodynamic drag profiles to mass equivalence, and assuming standard Overworld atmospheric pressure. Game engines are not perfect 1:1 simulations of reality, so this is an exercise in extrapolating parameters, not a definitive lore statement. Treat this as the "spherical cow in a vacuum" approach to Minecraft physics.
